I am a web developer, and I work mainly in the editorial field, specialized in backend development, experienced in developing with Django, Mysql and Spring MVC. 
I am always looking for ways to my development skills. 

I'm trying to raise awareness on topics like testing and documentation. And also on refactoring and dry principle

Currently in my spare time I am trying to improve my skills on django and reactjs through web application development

It would be nice to be able to do this by collaborating with someone :)
